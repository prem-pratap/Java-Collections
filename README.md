# Java-Collections
LIST QUESTIONS

1. Write a Java program to create an ArrayList, add all the months of a year and print the same.

2. 1) Create an application for employee management with the following classes:

a) Create an Employee class with following attributes and behaviors :
i) int empId
ii)String empName
iii)String email
iv)String gender 
v)float salary
vi) void GetEmployeeDetails() -> prints employee details

b) Create one more class EmployeeDB with the following attributes and behaviors.
(i)ArrayList list;
ii) boolean addEmployee(Employee e)  -> adds the employee object to the collection
iii) boolean deleteEmployee(int empId)  ->delete the employee object from the collection with the given empid
iv) String showPaySlip(int empId)  -> returns the payslip of the employee with the given empId

Provide implementation for all the methods and test your program.

3.Create an ArrayList that can store only Strings. 
Create a printAll method that will print all the elements of the ArrayList using an Iterator.

4.Create an ArrayList that can store only numbers like int,float,double,etc, but not any other data type.

5. Implement the assignment 1 using Linked List

6.Implement the assignment 1 using Vector

7.Write a program that will have a Vector which is capable of storing Employee objects. 
Use an Iterator and enumeration to list all the elements of the Vector.

SET QUESTIONS

1.Develop a java class with a instance variable H1 (HashSet)  add a method saveCountryNames(String CountryName) ,
the method should add the passed country to a HashSet (H1) and return the added HashSet(H1).
Develop a method getCountry(String CountryName) which iterates through the HashSet and returns the country 
if exist else return null. 
NOTE: You can test the methods using a main method.

2.Write a program to store a group of employee names into a HashSet, retrieve the elements one by one using an Iterator.

3. Create a Collection called TreeSet which is capable of storing String objects. Then try these following operations :
a) Reverse the elements of the Collection.
b) Iterate the elements of the TreeSet using Iterator.
c) Check if a particular element exists or not.

4. Implement the assignment 1 using TreeSet

MAP QUESTIONS

1. 1. Develop a java class with a instance variable M1 (HashMap)  create a method 
saveCountryCapital(String CountryName, String capital) , the method should add 
the passed country and capital as key/value in the map M1 and return the Map (M1).
Key- Country                          Value - Capital
India                                                   Delhi
Japan                                                Tokyo
2. Develop a method getCapital(String CountryName) which returns the capital for the country passed, 
from the Map M1 created in step 1.
3. Develop a method getCountry(String capitalName) which returns the country for the capital name, 
passed from the Map M1 created in step 1.
4. Develop a method which iterates through the map M1 and creates another map M2 with Capital as 
the key and value as Country and returns the Map M2.
Key – Capital                    Value – Country
Delhi                                           India
Tokyo                                        Japan
5. Develop a method which iterates through the map M1 and creates an ArrayList with all the 
Country names stored as keys. This method should return the ArrayList.
NOTE: You can test the methods using a main method.



2.Create a Collection called HashMap which is capable of storing String objects. The program should have the following abilities
a) Check if a particular key exists or not.
b) Check if a particular value exists or not.
c) Use Iterator to loop through the map.



3. Write a program that will have a Properties class object which is capable of storing some States of India and their Capital. 
Use an Iterator to list all the elements stored in the Properties.


4.  Create a Collection “ContactList” using HashMap to store name and phone number of contacts added.
The program should use appropriate generics (String, Integer) and have the following abilities:
a) Check if a particular key exists or not. 
b) Check if a particular value exists or not.
c) Use Iterator to loop through the map.


5.Implement the assignment 1 using TreeMap

6.Implement the assignment 1 using HashTable
